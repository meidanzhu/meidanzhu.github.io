> Programming is 10% writing code and 90% understanding why it's not working. 

Usually the beginning of everything is always the hardest. *( Wow! I finally wrote the first sentence of this blog after staring at the screen for a long long time.)   *  The good news is that once you have something written down, the flow continues and ideas starts to appear in your head. The credit for helping the class to build this CLI project from scratch using an API/scraping goes to Jenn, our instructor, for paving the way. Once the initial steps were introduced, we are well on our way. 

The steps:
1. Figure out what exactly I want to work on.
2. Obtain a API related to the topic.
3. Create a wireframe to illustrate the flow.
4. Create the appropriate files.
5. Using the API to fetch out the data used to create objects and methods.
6. Keep track of the interactions with the users.
7. Fixing the code!
8. Fixing the code!!
9. Fixing the code!!!
10. Fixing the code!!!!


1. My project idea was inspired by my trip to Disney World in January. As I was still stuck on what to do, I received a text from a friend saying “I want to go back to Florida again.” So I figured, why not relive the moment but through code. Moving on!
2. I got lucky when searching for the API for Disney. I found a pretty decent one where it includes information such as the parks and characters found at Disney. 
3. The wireframe that I created was just a basic sketch of the flow and how I’d like the user to interact with the program.
4. This step was where Jenn stepped in during an office hour. She gave us clear instructions on how to setup the files and kickstart that first line in the code. 
5. Looking at API can get pretty confusing especially if it’s messy. The application, JSON viewer can in handy for my eyes as it helped me declutter the mess and put all the data into a nice list form. From there, I was able to pull out the information I needed to create classes, objects and methods. I iterated through each category to create arrays and instance variables. 
6. The cli.rb file is where my mind gets jumbled a lot. It’s where I have to control the flow for the user to have an easy interaction with the codes. A lot of loops, if/else statements, and collection of inputs are present here. 

While working on this CLI project, I often find myself pausing to think about my next line of code. Questions upon questions will start to surface. How come this is not work? Where is this error coming from? How do I write this next step? Basically the “5Ws” and “How” kept appearing and they are inevitable when coding. Image all that frustration and stress knocking me down! However, to solve them, the resources online, help from others, trial and error was very useful to me this week. Shall I also include luck? Who would have though that I pulled through. Cheers to the beginning of this career!
