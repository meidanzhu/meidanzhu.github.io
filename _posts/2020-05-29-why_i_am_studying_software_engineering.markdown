Throughout this time of being quarantined at home, I realized that I am missing out on a lot of things in life. Although, I did have a good education and decent grades in classes, I felt lost immediately after graduation. I know that I could have done better, but I ended up choosing a path that did not fully utilize my assets. My whole perspective suddenly changed when I finally realized the situation that I have caused my parents to be in. They are hardworking and supporting people, and I also want to do my part in supporting for my family. My goal for applying to Flatiron Schoolâ€™s Software Engineering program is to successfully complete the curriculum, and turn everything I absorbed into experience. Even with some of my past experiences, I have little to no exposure to the tech field and unable to be employed at a tech company or agency due to my lack of experience. At first, I lost motivation in finding a career in this field, but now, I wish to gain more experiences to get those tech jobs. My hope is to gain experience and proudly insert them into a resume that  that expresses myself as well as showcase my personal projects to allow potential employers to recognize my skill.  I do not want to let time be wasted and I want to see myself working at tech companies in the future.
