For the past few months, I was so used to writing code in Ruby that the switch from Ruby to JavaScript was difficult for me. The hardest part of learning JavaScript was understanding that functions are first-class objects that can be assigned to a variable, can have properties and be passed as a parameter to another function. In JavaScript, functions are first class citizens. They can be returned from functions and accepted as arguments to functions. 

The pros of JavaScript

- It is both powerful & confusing that JS supports different programming paradigms such as OO, functional and procedural programming. So it’s up to you programmer to chose pattern and solution.

- JS, in fact, is language for the ‘browser’ and that means you need to add html, css, dom and all their fancy frameworks and libraries. Awesome.

- Constant competition among different fast-self-improving frameworks and libraries for being the most beautiful, useful or popular or whatever for JS. This endless level of abstraction to “improve” JS makes it more difficult to feel like you actually learned something…because it seems you’re just playing catching up…with the latest out there at the forefront. New week, new announcement.

-  It’s hard to filter out the noise. It’s simply too much information that is available for learning, too many tools in a toolbox. Everyone who can print out “hello world” feels entitled to post online tutorial and crash course you into JS rabbit hole.
