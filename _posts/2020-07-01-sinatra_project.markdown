Before the July 4th break, we worked on the Sinatra project to have a better understanding of CRUD and RESTful routes. Overall, my experience with these lessons and labs was pleasing. Beginning with SQL, althought sometimes the challenge of joinning tables confuses me, I was able to grasp the concept much easier compared to the previous subject matter. This project was enjoyable and I had a lot of fun using ActiveRecord to build this MVC app. 

I worked at a wedding studio a few years ago and the idea for my app was inspired from that. My role as a graphic designer was to photo edit and create the wedding albums for our clients. Through that work experience, I was able to recognize the bride's stuggle when it comes to wedding planning. I say bride because usually, they are the one that makes the decision when it comes to their big day. They have to keep in account of their budget, schedule and communication with all the vendor of choice. 

I have a User model for the bride who has_many relationship with the Vendor model which belongs_to the Bride model. After distringuishing that connection, it is time to create the databate that corresponds to each column and attributes. Working on the controllers, I was able to create the routes that the user can interact with the resource such as sign up, login, add, edit, delete, and fill out forms. 

Binding.pry should and will always be a coder's best friend, its the most helpful gem to check the data and fix any mistakes. I would like to get in the habit of put binding.pry after every line of code just to assure myself that everything works and some code won't break after 10 minutes. I love running "shotgun" to see the working prototype and even if some pages broke, I'm so glad that they gave useful debugging hints. This project allowed me to have a refresher on my rusty HTML and CSS skills. I was able to play with the layout and add a little visual element to make the homepage be a little visually appealing. I had fun with this project and I can't wait to learn more when we come back from the well desreved break.
